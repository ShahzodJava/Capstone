# Casting Agency API
### Description
This is project is the final project for the Udacity Full Stack Wev Developer Nanodegree. The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. In this API I implemented third-party authentication with Role Based Access Control using Auth0.
